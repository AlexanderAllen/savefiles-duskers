You know for a fact that those vessels are seriously prone to ventilation malfunctions. They almost always lead to an increase in toxin levels causing hallucinations and paranoia. Following the lack of symptomatic details in the transmission, I have a number of questions about how Holmes avoided infection, questions I'd like answered. Top priority is to locate his vessel and investigate under required Quarantine Statues, determine what actually happened out there. We've locked onto his vessels dock ID via SSB and are awaiting its name and last known location from CIC records.

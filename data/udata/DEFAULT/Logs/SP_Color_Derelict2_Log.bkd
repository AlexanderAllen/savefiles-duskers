Hey John, got a message off  Molly yesterday again, she says she misses you. I know ©ÂðÕøÓåß¥¾ÏÎØ«çÓýÒÍÜÖéÚÔ¸£ÝâÐû×çÌÏµÐ¹¼ÌíãõíµºÒÜ least deserves that don't you think? 
 
On a side note, have you heard about the new restrictions we’ve placed on the gates? Came through command this afternoon. Pretty happy about it if I'm being honest, the more secure we can be with all these rumours flying around the better.

Anyway, I've gotta go. Message Molly alright! ¨ã§ÎöÜñèÔ¼£Ý¾®ÎÛ××me I'm station bound.

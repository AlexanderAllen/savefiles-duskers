At around 05:00 hours, our sensors picked öÂé§ unidentified object within our crafts vicinity. The object was m¯Í laterally alongside us, as if it was locked on Ì¿ôÔäÕâ÷ÙØition at a point of observation.

We managed to obtain a scan result öÎøÙ¬ÏÝÕþú no humanoid life signs were detected, although a strange sequence of enúúgy signals were.

ñ±ÚáÒëer, was not the strangest thing about the encounter. The vessel was a named 'The Marlin'. An old cargo ¶Ñèá¸f ship that had been decommissioned years ago, most are now derelicts.

Concerned that soíãçííúÝr something, had illegally commandeered a governmenæ»ÎÕýêØ vessel, I sent a distress signal to all nearby outposts, alerting them of our current situation.

Then aéãéòç¦×ÐþáóõÚåÛðàØÏìÕèeared, the object had gone.

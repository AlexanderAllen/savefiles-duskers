I can't really explain what I mean by that right now, but what I can tell you isÚ«úÁ¤çÏe detected wave fluctuations in the central zone of the anomaly, so®ûõÏå¡of disruption. 

Then, and this is wÄÍre is gets really interesting, we detected a signal. ïùÅ¤ÛÏ¼õÓÖÚëd not make out a message, it was clear that whatever was sending that signal out was human. The origin point? Some form of vessel or probe from wàÎ¿ÎäÂcould tell.

We have to cross-reference all of this, because it could easily be some floating wreckage still firing. But James, this is really, really exciting.
